A cross-platform app to change habits and preferences in Reading
while being user-friendly and responsive.

This app is now available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.developers.plethora) (Stable Release v1.0)

## Instructions for Deployment

This application was created using the .NET MAUI framework
from Microsoft.

To successfully run this app you would need

- .NET MAUI installed on a Windows, Mac or Linux machine.
- NuGet package of `Maui-Community-Toolkit-Mvvm`.

This app is cross-platform but is built specifically for mobile
users both iOS and Android.

## Precautions

- This is not yet a production-level deployed app on the AppStore or PlayStore.
Instead, to properly visualize the app working, an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio or
JetBrains Rider is required.

> Note to JetBrains Rider Users: To run this application you would require
> a Java Development Kit of Version 11.0.0 or higher. You will also require an Android SDK package
> to visualize the Android version of the app.

- Ensure that your IDE recognises the Solution file (file with `.sln` extension) to properly run all
C# and XAML code for the app.
